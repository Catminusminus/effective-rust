# effective-rust: Effect System for Rust

*DISCLAIMER: I have not read any papers regarding Algebraic Effects nor
even used programming languages with them such as Eff, Multicore OCaml, and Koka.
I'm just mimicking their looks. If you find any misunderstandings, feel free to 
[open an issue](https://github.com/pandaman64/effective-rust/issues/new)
or tweet to [me](https://twitter.com/__pandaman64__)!*
